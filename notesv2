$_   ==  pipeline involved use $_ 
$args === array of undeclared parameters that have been passed to the function use $args instead if you dont use #param ( 
$input = enumerates a list of all the paramaeters that was passed to it so if you have spoemthing that ask for a input but they dont give you a function virable just do $input
(if it involes a process block then you might be using $input)
